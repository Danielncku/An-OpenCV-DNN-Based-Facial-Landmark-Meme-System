# An OpenCV DNN–Based Facial Landmark Meme System

## Project Overview
This project implements a real-time facial landmark–based Clash Royale meme system using OpenCV and deep neural networks (DNN).  
By combining face detection, facial landmark extraction, and heuristic-based action recognition, the system analyzes facial expressions and upper-body gestures from a webcam feed and triggers corresponding animated memes (GIFs) in real time.

The project demonstrates how lightweight deep learning models and traditional computer vision techniques can be integrated to build an interactive human–computer interaction system without large-scale model training.

## Environment Setup

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a Python virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Run The Project
```bash
python main.py
```
